# AI News Summarizer 🧠📰

A modern React-based AI News application that fetches real-time news and uses Hugging Face models to generate simplified, reader-friendly summaries.

## Why JavaScript (JSX) Only?

This project intentionally uses **JavaScript instead of TypeScript** to:

- Improve readability for recruiters and beginners
- Reduce configuration complexity
- Avoid unnecessary type overhead for a frontend-focused project
- Ensure faster onboarding and easier maintenance

TypeScript files generated by AI tools were fully converted to JavaScript to maintain a **clean, consistent codebase**.
