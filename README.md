## ❓ Why JavaScript (JSX) Only?

This project intentionally uses **JavaScript instead of TypeScript** to:

- Improve readability for recruiters and beginners

- Make the code easier to understand at first glance  

All TypeScript files generated by AI tools were converted into clean JavaScript to maintain a consistent codebase.
